## Introduction
My name is Colm Woodlock (student number: G00341460) and this is my project for the mobile applications module in 3rd year of GMIT.
This app is a simple game where the goal is to tap all the red circles before the time runs out.

## How to run the app
1. Clone the repository using the following command: git clone https://github.com/cwoodlock/MobileAppsProject.git
2. Open the colned repository and click on the Project.sln file
3. When prompted by the system to select a program to open the wile with select Visual Studio 2015.

## How I approached the problem
I wanted to create a simple game, and the premise of ths game is that the user is presented with a grid of circles and some of them are red. These red circles would be randomly generated. The user then has a number of seconds to tap/click on each red circle before the time runs out. There are a number of levels each getting progressivly harder, be it with less time or with more circles to press. With this in mind I was able to build the app up in steps. 
1. First I created the main page which would be the main navigation page. Here you could start the game from level one or go into the level selector and choose a level to do.
2. From here I made the first level
3. Once the first level was finished it was easy to adapt it to another level.
